    "instructions": "#### Overview\n\nYou will assess the quality of textual statements and their references for different queries.\nThe assessment will comprise several quality dimensions.\nOnly the response and the reference should be assessed for its quality, not the query.\n\nYou can display the instructions at any time by clicking on the \"i\" button on the top left of the questionnaire.</p>\n\n#### Process\n- Read each query-response pair carefully\n- Answer all questions for each pair using the provided rating scale\n- You must complete all questions before submitting; the submit button is disabled until all questions are answered.\n- You can revise your answers at any time before submitting. Once submitted, your answer is final.\n\nBy proceeding, you consent to your annotation data being used for scientific purposes. You can withdraw that consent any time by unchecking the consent option at the top right. Note that we can only compensate you via Prolific if you consent with our data usage policy. \n\n**Once successfully submitted, the page will update to display a completion code you can enter in Prolific to mark the task as done.**\n\n#### Rating Scale\nEach question asks to rate the response between two polar opposites A and B, for example \"Is the statement colloquial or formal?\". Ratings are given on a 4-point scale:\n\n- **Very colloquial** (fully encompassing concept A)\n- **Somewhat colloquial** (partially encompassing concept A, more than concept B)\n- **Somewhat formal** (partially encompassing concept B, more than concept A)\n- **Very formal** (fully encompassing concept B)\n\n#### Navigation\nNavigate between items using the navigation buttons at the bottom of the questionnaire.\n\n- Use the  arrows to move between items\n- The dots show your progress and completion status\n- Click on any dot to jump to the corresponding item",
